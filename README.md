## What is the diversity-innovation paradox?
Diversity breeds innovation, yet underrepresented groups that diversify organizations have less successful careers within them.

## Research Questions
1. How do we detect innovations in open source projects?
2. What are different measurements of diversity of groups of open source contributors?
3. Are diverse groups ([in terms of gender and tenure](https://cmustrudel.github.io/papers/chi15.pdf), and distribution of work) of contributors more likely to generate innovations?
4. Does more innovations from an individual mean a longer open course career?
